/*
We are given a hashmap which maps all the letters with number. Given 1 is mapped with A, 2 is mapped with Bâ€¦..26 is mapped with Z. Given a number, you have to print all the possible strings.

Input Format
A single line contains a number.

Constraints
Number is less than 10^6

Output Format
Print all the possible strings in sorted order in different lines.

Sample Input
123
Sample Output
ABC
AW
LC
Explanation
'1' '2' '3' = ABC
'1' '23' = AW
'12' '3' = LC

	 * To Solve any Problem related to Recursion All you need to do is Break the
	 * Problem into 3 important components which are as follows :-
	 * 1.Bigger Problem : The original Problem statement is your bigger problem.
	 * 2.Smaller Problem: In every recursive prblm there exist a prblm statement
	 * which you need to achieve in order to fullfill the prblm statement but by
	 * considering such a smaller prblm from the bigger prblm is needed which we
	 * need to assume that the recursion will work and will give the answer.
	 * 3.Self Work: The amount of work which one should do in order to make the
	 * smaller problem your problem.
	 * 
	 * For e.g.., In order to find the max of any array, three components will be :-
	 * Bigger Problem : To find the max in whole array viz find max in array from
	 * index 0 to n - 1.
	 * 
	 * Smaller Problem: Assume that the recursion works and will find the max of
	 * array from index 1 to n - 1.
	 * 
	 * Self Work : In order to make your smaller prblm your bigger prblm all you
	 * need to do is to compare the ans return by assuming the smaller prblm works
	 * with the 0th index element and return the max among both of them.
	 * Approach Discussion
	 * 
	 * Bigger Problem : To Print all of the possible mapped String of given number.
	 * Smaller Problem : Assume the recursion works and will give you ans for just
	 * after the first digit.
	 * 
	 * Self Work : In order to make you smaller prblm your problem all you need to
	 * work for the 0th index element. Because it could be the part included in the
	 * answer or not. So first number could be mapped as it is or can be mapped by
	 * including just the next digit with. For e.g.., 123 either first digit will be
	 * mapped as '1' or as '12' but not for '123'
	 * 
	 * Note : Do handle that the number should be smaller than 26 as for two digit
	 * number could be like 321 so your recursion will take either 3 or 32 but 32 is
	 * not valid.
